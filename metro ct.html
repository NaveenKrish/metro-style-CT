								<p><strong>Description and Time Frame For Each</strong></p>	
								<ul>
									<li>PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES:</li>
									<ul>
									<li>Description: Investigator-assessed objective PFS was measured from the date of randomization to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. For patients not known to have died as of the data cutoff date and who did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at the date of last objective tumor assessment. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. PD = 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.</li>
									<li>Time Frame: Date of randomization to the date of measured PD or date of death from any cause (up to 19.3 months)</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : INDEPENDENTLY-ASSESSED OBJECTIVE PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL (PFS)</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Description: To further evaluate the robustness of the PFS analysis, Lilly established an independent review of PFS to assess the potential for investigator bias in the determination of objective PD. PFS was measured from the date of randomization to the first date of objectively determined PD or death. For patients alive as of the data cutoff date and who did not have PD, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective tumor assessment. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. PD = 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.</li>
										<li>Time Frame: Date of randomization to first date of measured PD or date of death from any cause (up to 19.3 months)</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS)</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Description: OS is the duration from enrollment to death. For patients who are alive, OS is censored at the last contact.</li>
										<li>Time Frame: Date of randomization to the date of death from any cause up to 39.5 months.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN THE EUROQOL INSTRUMENT (EQ-5D) INDEX SCORE</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Description: The EQ-5D is a generic instrument that describes health status in 5 attributes (mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, usual activities) using a three level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These combinations of attributes are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United Kingdom (UK) population-based algorithm. The possible values for the Index Score range from -0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension).</li>
										<li>Time Frame: Baseline randomization through 30-day post-discontinuation visit (up to 19.3 months).</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN EUROQOL INSTRUMENT (EQ-5D) VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS)</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Description: Patients indicate their present health state through completion of the VAS. Possible scores range from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</li>
										<li>Time Frame: Baseline randomization through 30-day post-discontinuation visit (up to 19.3 months).</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : PERCENTAGE OF PARTICIPANTS WITH HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO ADVERSE EVENTS OR REQUIRING TRANSFUSION (RESOURCE UTILIZATION).</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Time Frame: Baseline randomization through 30-day post-discontinuation visit (up to 19.3 months).</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : PERCENTAGE OF PARTICIPANTS WITH A NON-SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (AE) DURING MAINTENANCE PHASE.</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Description: A summary of non-serious AEs is located in the Reported Adverse Event Module.</li>
										<li>Time Frame: Baseline randomization through 30-day post-discontinuation visit (up to 49.7 months).</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : PERCENTAGE OF PARTICIPANTS WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS DURING MAINTENANCE PHASE</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Description: A summary of serious adverse events is located in the Reported Adverse Event Module.</li>    
										<li>Time Frame: Baseline randomization through 30-day post-discontinuation visit (up to 49.7 months).</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: PERCENTAGE OF PARTICIPANTS WITH OBJECTIVE TUMOR RESPONSE (RESPONSE RATE) DURING MAINTENANCE PHASE OF STUDY UP TO PRIMARY DATA CUT-OFF</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Description: Analysis for combined phases was not performed since response was calculated separately for each phase of study. Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response(PR)is at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease(PD) is at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease(SD)=no change or small changes that do not meet the above criteria for CR, PR, or PD.</li>
										<li>Time Frame: Baseline to date of measured progressive disease (up to 19.3 months).</li>
									</ul>	
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : PERCENTAGE OF PARTICIPANTS WITH INDEPENDENTLY-ASSESSED OBJECTIVE TUMOR RESPONSE (RESPONSE RATE) DURING MAINTENANCE PHASE UP TO PRIMARY DATA CUT-OFF.</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Description: Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD)=no change or small changes that do not meet the above criteria for CR, PR, or PD. Response Rate = (CR+PR)/Participants in Arm*100. Disease Control Rate=(CR+PR+SD)/Number of Participants in Arm*100.</li>
